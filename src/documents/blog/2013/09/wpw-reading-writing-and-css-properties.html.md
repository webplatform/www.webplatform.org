Are you finding it difficult to think about reference documentation when fall is in the air?

I stood in the playground at my son’s school this morning, watching the kids kick balls, play hopscotch, and text each other across the school yard. The leaves on the trees were beginning to show the autumnal colors that mark the end of summer. The bell rang, marking the start of the day, and the children grabbed their shiny backpacks from where they had dropped them. They headed off into the school, toward their individual classrooms, prepared to face their lessons and assignments.

Likewise for us, the halcyon days of summer have drawn to a close. I left the playground and travelled until I walked up to the front door of my office building and took note of the leaves changing colors (as well as my coworkers kicking balls around the parking lot and playing hopscotch on the sidewalk). I though about the kerjillion leaves I will soon have to rake up, and I literally sighed as I opened the door, my laptop weighing heavily in my backpack.

But I am an optimist, my friends, and so I soon turned my frown upside down. For the beginning of fall means heading back to school and work to dig into those special projects we've recently neglected in favor of frivolous summer pursuits. But which projects to tackle first?

"Why, what a lucky day," I thought!  "There are CSS properties just waiting for our WPW fall cleanup!"

When you’ve finished your lunch (don’t forget to drink your milk), grab your coat and join me out in the WPD school yard. We'll head to the [Web Platform Wednesdays page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday) where we'll see that for the 2013 Sep 4 entry, we’ve got this pithy request:

Go through the [Web Platform Wednesday past reports](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/past_reports) and choose one that hasn't been completed. You might want to start with [last week's list](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/past_reports/2013-August#21_August_2013_-_Week_J), revisit summer with all of [August](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/past_reports/2013-August), or look for outliers in [July](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/past_reports/2013-July)!

Oh, but I know that you’re a tetherball champion. And you--yes, you--didn't you swing over the top of the bar last spring? So sign up for two CSS properties! Heck, I double dare you to choose three. And let’s see how many of the properties we can get cleaned up before the last leaf hits the ground.

Thanks so much for your help. And thanks for indulging my inner child.
