![](//static.webplatform.org/wpd-blog/2013/09/WPDS_CH2.jpg)The first ever Swiss Web Platform Doc Sprint is a wrap! Pure stat hunters might have liked to see more attendees: 15 out of 31 registrants attending resulted in a 52% no-show, which is pretty unusual for Switzerland; this was probably due to the current holiday season as well as the pouring rain. But hey, this is clearly about quality not quantity, so let's talk more about the **longest traveller to the sprint**: [Francesco](https://twitter.com/franciov), who came in **from Rome, Italy**. Or how about **probably the youngest ever Doc Sprint attendee**, [Samarth](https://twitter.com/Samarthwiz) (age 13), who made the [script tag](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/script) shine on Web Platform Docs!

Chris Mills from Mozilla presented a guide to using the Wiki, making edits, and what work we aimed to achieve. The fifteen very motivated and skilled contributors were a fairly even mix of Web Platform veterans and newcomers, and jumped head-first in to a variety of tasks ranging from bug investigation to example coding and doc writing.

We'd like to say a **special thanks** to Mike West (Google) and contributor Rodney Rehm (who already attended the [Berlin Doc Sprint](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2013/02/20/doc-sprints-to-an-awesome-european-start/)) — they helped attendees with 1:1 support on various questions over the day. Next, let's give a big shout-out to our lovely venue sponsors [Colab Zurich](http://colab-zurich.ch), who provided delicious catering for the full day, and to Adobe, who made the event possible by providing everything throughout the day.

A huge **thank you** to all attendees of this Doc Sprint!
