From the simple to the advanced, CSS has a lot of effects to offer with a little bit of code. This week we're documenting background, border, and transform properties. And looking around, there's a lot of great advice and tools out there.

For instance, did you know there's a site out there just to help you create a border radius? The site's name? [border-radius.com](http://border-radius.com/), of course. And at the other end of the spectrum, Mike Sierra's [article on CSS transforms](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/css_transforms) takes a deck of cards and shuffles them every which way.

Shay Howe also has a straightforward [transforms tutorial](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms) that takes you from the basics to a 3D cube demo, before you even know how far you've gone. And then there's the hoedown with backgrounds from Rob Fletcher, who shows out to do [CSS background transformations](http://blog.freeside.co/post/42357804660/css-background-transformations) the right way. While you're at it, check out Chris Coyer's [introduction to animation](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/97-intro-to-css-animations/).

With so much help from such a creative community, it's really fun to beef up the reference pages for these properties. Head on over to the [Web Platform Wednesday page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday) and see where you can lend your creativity. If you find any properties you want to work on, or have questions about, come and chat with the co-ordinators in the [#webplatform](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) IRC Channel or via email on [the mailing list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org), as there is always someone who will be happy to help.
