<h2>By the way, do you know what a 403 error is?</h2>
<p>
	Every HTTP request returns a three digit code in the beginning which communicates how
	everything went in a compact way.
	These numbers are known as HTTP status codes.
	Specifically, 403 is a code that means “Forbidden”, i.e. the server either can’t access the file, or is asked to forbid access.
