<h2>By the way, do you know what a 404 error is?</h2>
<p>
	Every HTTP request returns a three digit code in the beginning which communicates how
	everything went in a compact way.
	These numbers are known as HTTP status codes.
	Specifically, 404 is a code that means “Not found”, i.e. there is no resource at the
	specified address.
